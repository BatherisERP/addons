Stock Barcode Sound
===================

This module adds two little improvements to the processing of picking lines
through the JS barcode interface:

- When a barcode is scanned, the interface window is scrolled to show the
  scanned element as the first one. That's specially useful if your picking
  has a lot of lines.

- When a barcode is scanned and processed a different sound is played
  depending on if the barcode has been found or not.
